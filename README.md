# Sigmoid-Neuron-Model

Learning and Implementing the Sigmoid Neuron Model from Scratch.

A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula:

{\displaystyle S(x)={\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}}}={\frac {e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}}.}{\displaystyle S(x)={\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}}}={\frac {e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}}.}




This repository is the implementation of the Sigmoid Neuron Model on some arbitary datset.
