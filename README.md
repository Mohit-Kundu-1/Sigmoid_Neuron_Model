# Sigmoid-Neuron-Model

Learning and Implementing the Sigmoid Neuron Model from Scratch.

A sigmoid function is a mathematical function having a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function shown in the first figure and defined by the formula:

**Application of Sigmoid Function- **

Many natural processes, such as those of complex system learning curves, exhibit a progression from small beginnings that accelerates and approaches a climax over time. When a specific mathematical model is lacking, a sigmoid function is often used.

The van Genuchtenâ€“Gupta model is based on an inverted S-curve and applied to the response of crop yield to soil salinity.

Examples of the application of the logistic S-curve to the response of crop yield (wheat) to both the soil salinity and depth to water table in the soil are shown in logistic function#In agriculture: modeling crop response.

In artificial neural networks, sometimes non-smooth functions are used instead for efficiency; these are known as hard sigmoids.

In audio signal processing, sigmoid functions are used as waveshaper transfer functions to emulate the sound of analog circuitry clipping.

In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill equation and Hill-Langmuir equation are sigmoid functions.

In computer graphics, and real-time rendering, some of the sigmoid functions are used to blend colors or geometry, between two values smoothly and without visible seams or discontinuities.

This repository is the implementation of the Sigmoid Neuron Model on some arbitary datset.
